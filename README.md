# Orion

A descrete, server-validated chat system in Roblox.

## Features

- Notified: know when a user is aware of your message, but has not opened it yet.
- Secure: no data is given to the client without documentation. For example, when the client gets the message data, the server marks the conversation as "Read."

## Disclaimer

This chat system does NOT include callbacks to Roblox's built in chat filter, which is against the Roblox Community Guidelines. This project is purely for personal enjoyment and educational purposes. Use at your own risk.
